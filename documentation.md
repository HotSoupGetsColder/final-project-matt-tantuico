## What is this game?

I was asking the same exact question several weeks ago. This is a semi-sophisticated game titled _**Bagels on a Sunday**_. As the name suggests, you serve bagels _AND_ it is a Sunday. Working behind the counter of a bagel shop, you fufill the requests of hungry customers. However, you may ask, "But how will I know what bagel to make?". If you pay close attention, you may notice how the customers' hats and shirts correspond to the bagel toppings and types. Hmmm . . .
